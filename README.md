# Omar's Personal Website – Goblin M0D3

This repository hosts the source code for my public site:  
🌐 **[niiro92othman.github.io/Omar](https://niiro92othman.github.io/Omar/)**

A chaotic, creative hub for everything that defines me — IT, gaming, music, 3D printing, and more. The website is built entirely in static HTML and hosted on GitHub Pages.
